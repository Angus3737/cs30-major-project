# CS30 Major Project

## Description
I am planning on building a computer version of chinese chess

## Needs To Have List
- all the pieces
- the castle, which the king and guards cannot escape
- rule which doesnâ€™t allow the kings to face each other
- horse and elephants blocking rule
- highlights possible moves and possible captures
- highlights kings square when in check
- sound effects for capturing pieces


## Nice To Have List
- after a player moves, the board will rotate 180 degrees
- all time record. Record red wins vs black wins
- displaying the captured pieces on the side
- different texture packs
- have reminders for special rules pop up on the screen
