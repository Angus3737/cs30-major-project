# Major Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself?
- Use oldX, oldY, newX, and newY for piece positions
- Create a varible for counting pieces in between, for cannon and king
- Must create elements for off canvas text

## Was everything in needs to have completed?
- Most of the components I wanted were completed. Only highlighting the possible moves was missing. I did manage to include other components such as "easy access instructions", so I am very happy wwith the end result

## The hardest part?
- The logic for mouse pressed, it was selecting a piece and moving it
- Starting the function for moving pieces, the pieces follow similar starter logic. Finishing the first onwe helped alot

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
- Yes, there wasn't enough time left for me to finish a function that highlights the possible squares a piece could move to
